# Opensearch cluster w/ 3 manager nodes, 2 data/ingest nodes, and a dashboard node
# Needs minimum ~ 5 GB RAM on the host

# TODO: leave ports as is?
# TODO: add healthcheck and depends_on dashboard -> nodes -> managers
# TODO: why are containers using so much mem? 700-800MB for managers, 1G for data nodes.
# Verified the Xmx heap options ARE taking effect based on 'heap size' log message
# TODO: Disable un-needed plugins?
